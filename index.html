          Esports, or electronic sports, is the competitive playing of video
          games at a professional level. It has seen exponential growth over the
          years, driven by advancements in technology, online connectivity,
          increased investment and sponsorship, growing viewership, and
          globalization.
          What began as a niche hobby has transformed into a multi-billion
          dollar industry with a global audience, featuring professional players
          and teams competing in tournaments ranging from local events to
          massive international championships with substantial prize pools.
          The future of esports appears promising, with ongoing innovation
          and mainstream acceptance poised to propel the industry to even
          greater heights.
