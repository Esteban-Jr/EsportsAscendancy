            The International (TI) is Dota 2's premier esports tournament,
            hosted annually by Valve Corporation. TI distinguishes itself with
            its unique crowd funding model, setting it apart from other esports
            events. The crowd funding model used for events like TI is primarily
            facilitated through the sale of in-game items, such as the
            Compendium or Battle Pass in Dota 2.<br />Before each iteration of
            The International, Valve releases a digital compendium or Battle
            Pass, which players can purchase within the Dota 2 client. These
            items typically offer a variety of in-game rewards, such as
            exclusive cosmetics, player cards, voice lines, and more.<br />
            A portion of the proceeds from the sale of Compendiums/Battle Passes
            is allocated to the prize pool for The International. Valve
            typically sets an initial prize pool, and as players purchase
            Compendiums/Battle Passes, the prize pool increases in real-time,
            often surpassing the initial amount by a significant margin.<br />
            To encourage more sales and contributions to the prize pool, Valve
            often sets stretch goals and incentives tied to certain milestones.
            For example, reaching a specific prize pool threshold may unlock
            additional in-game rewards or features for all Compendium/Battle
            Pass owners, incentivizing further purchases and contributions.<br />Valve
            provides regular updates on the progress of the prize pool
            throughout the duration of the crowdfunding period. Players can
            track the current prize pool total in real-time through the Dota 2
            client or official website, creating excitement and anticipation as
            the prize pool continues to grow. The crowd funding model fosters
            community engagement and participation, as players feel personally
            invested in the success of The International.<br />
            By purchasing Compendiums/Battle Passes, players not only support
            the tournament but also gain access to exclusive content and
            contribute to the overall excitement and atmosphere surrounding the
            event. Therefore, the crowd funding model has played a pivotal role
            in The International's ability to achieve the highest prize pool in
            esports history.<br />
            The International 10 (TI10) in 2021 had a prize pool that exceeded
            $40 million USD. Before The International 10 (TI10) in 2021, the
            previous highest prize pool in esports was also from The
            International. The International 9 (TI9), held in 2019, had a
            record-breaking prize pool that exceeded $34 million USD. This
            milestone solidified The International's position as the premier
            esports event and underscored the significant growth and impact of
            competitive gaming on a global scale.<br />
            Overall, the crowd funding model used for events like The
            International has been highly successful, allowing the Dota 2
            community to directly contribute to the prize pool and play a
            significant role in the success of the tournament. It has become a
            key aspect of the annual esports calendar, generating hype and
            excitement among players and fans alike.
